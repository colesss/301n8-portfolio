Transfer your collection of data over to a .json file, replacing your original file.
JSON-Lint to the rescue!
Continue to follow good SMACSS principles.
Be sure to use the correct jQuery method for each AJAX call.
Be thoughtful when functions are executed asynchronously. This is a major source of bugs!

Pretty simple adaptation for today's portfolio assignment: Set it up to run from a server.js file as we did with the blog app in lab.

Skipping?

Your Portfolio for Class 10 - Functional Programming!
Scopes and closures and IIFE's, oh my! :grimacing:

Apply some functional programming concepts to your portfolio codebase.

Eliminate all for loops.

Use map where you are transforming one collection into another.

In at least one place, enclose the contents of a script file in an IIFE, that exports your high-level objects.

Refactor any parts of your app that could be more loosely coupled. Make smaller functions that can accept and expect the return values of other functions!

Think of a useful way to use reduce. Maybe you want to put some "fun facts stats" in your footer?

Technical Requirements:

Use of at least one .map() method.
Use of at least one .reduce() method.
IIFE present on at least one .js file.

We converted the blog into a SPA by using the page.js library to capture clicks and execute a function to modify the page, rather than reloading content from a server.

Give your portfolio the same treatment. Update your main nav so that each clickable item is a link to a different url, that is handled by a function as indicated by page.js.

Keep your code organized in a M-V-C structure that isolates data management from presentation layer, from the controller that holds it all together.
